# PDFMerge

PDFMerge is a simple application which allows you to merge two PDFs which have the same number of pages into one document, collating the front and back pages accordingly.

Usually this is used for easily collating scans of front and back pages of a scanned document. In that case, usually the back pages will be in reverse order. For example:

```
Front pages PDF:
 * Page 1 is page 1 of the collated document.
 * Page 2 is page 3 of the collated document.
 * Page 3 is page 5 of the collated document.

Back pages PDF:
 * Page 1 is page 6 of the collated document.
 * Page 2 is page 4 of the collated document.
 * Page 3 is page 2 of the collated document.
```
